# CHKN

CHKN (also known as ChickenGear.com) is my answer to Adobe Experience Manager's ["WKND" tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/introduction/getting-started.html?lang=en).

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the Adobe Experience Manager platform. I've documented the CHKN journey in the [CHKN Tutorial](https://github.com/epaulson08/AemNotes/blob/main/tutorial/CHKN-tutorial.md).

## Setup
To run CHKN, you will need a local AEM instance as well as some dependencies and a content package. There is a detailed walkthrough in the [tutorial](docs/tutorial/setup.md).

If you already have an AEM as a Cloud Service local environment set up:
- Clone this repo
- Build the code from the project root directory:
```
mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
```
